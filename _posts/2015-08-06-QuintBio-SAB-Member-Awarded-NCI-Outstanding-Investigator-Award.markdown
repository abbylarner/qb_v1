**About Quintessence Biosciences**
Quintessence Biosciences, Inc. is a private company developing novel anti-cancer compounds based on our patented EVade™ Ribonuclease technology. The drug is differentiated, targeting the RNA in cancer cells. Dose escalation of our most advanced lead candidate, QBI-139, in a Phase I trial has recently been completed. The safety profile of the drug is distinct from chemotherapy. Based on encouraging signs of efficacy, partners are being sought for expansion cohorts to evaluate efficacy of QBI-139 in defined patient populations. The drug had a strong therapeutic window against a variety of in vivo xenograft models including: colon, non-small cell lung, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer.
